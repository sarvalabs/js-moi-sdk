/**
 * This is an abstract class that provides the base functionality for
 * signing and verifying messages and interactions. It also provides the ability to
 * create and execute interactions.
 *
 * Inheriting classes must implement the abstract methods ``getKeyId``, ``getIdentifier``,
 * ``sign``, and ``signInteraction``.
 *
 * .. js:method:: getKeyId
 *
 *      Retrieves the key ID of the participant.
 *
 *      `This is an abstract method that must be implemented by the inheriting class.`
 *
 *      :returns: A promise that resolves to the key ID of the participant.
 *
 * .. js:method:: getIdentifier
 *
 *      Retrieves the identifier of the participant.
 *
 *      `This is an abstract method that must be implemented by the inheriting class.`
 *
 *      :returns: A promise that resolves to the identifier of the signer.
 *
 * .. js:method:: sign
 *
 *      Signs a message using the provided signature type.
 *
 *      `This is an abstract method that must be implemented by the inheriting class.`
 *
 *      :param message: The message to sign.
 *      :type message: Hex | Uint8Array
 *      :param sig: The signature type to use.
 *      :type sig: SigType
 *
 *      :returns: A promise that resolves to the hex-encoded signed message.
 *
 * .. js:method:: signInteraction
 *
 *      Signs an interaction request using the provided signature type.
 *
 *      `This is an abstract method that must be implemented by the inheriting class.`
 *
 *      :param ix: The interaction request to sign.
