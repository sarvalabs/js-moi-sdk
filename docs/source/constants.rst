Constants
=========

The constants module contains the following constant variables.

Installation
------------

This package is already included in the ``js-moi-sdk`` package, if you want to install
`js-moi-constants <https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-moi-constants>`_ package separately,
you can install it using the following command:

**Using npm**

.. code-block:: bash

    npm install js-moi-constants

**Using yarn**

.. code-block:: bash

    yarn add js-moi-constants

**Using pnpm**

.. code-block:: bash

    pnpm add js-moi-constants

Version
-------
The ``VERSION`` constant represents the version number of the 
js-moi-sdk package.

.. code-block:: javascript

    import { VERSION } from "js-moi-sdk";

    console.log(VERSION)

    >> "0.6.0"

MOI Derivation Path
-------------------
The ``MOI_DERIVATION_PATH`` constant is the path used to derive MOI account 
addresses. It specifies the sequence of steps and indices involved in the 
derivation process.

.. code-block:: javascript

    import { MOI_DERIVATION_PATH } from "js-moi-sdk";

    console.log(MOI_DERIVATION_PATH)

    >> "m/44'/6174'/0'/0/0"

MOI Derivation Base Path
------------------------
The ``MOI_DERIVATION_BASE_PATH`` constant represents the foundational path for 
generating MOI account addresses. It serves as the initial part of the 
derivation path, with additional indices appended to create unique MOI account 
addresses.

.. code-block:: javascript

    import { MOI_DERIVATION_BASE_PATH } from "js-moi-sdk";

    console.log(MOI_DERIVATION_BASE_PATH)

    >> "m/44'/6174'/0'/0"
